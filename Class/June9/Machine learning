Machine Learning is a category of algorithm that allows the software to become more accurate  in predicting outcomes
without being explicitly programmed. The basic premise of machine learning is to build an algorithm that can receive input data
and use statistical analysis to predict an output while updating outputs as new data becomes available.

The process involved in machine learning are similar to that of data making and predictive modeling. Both require searching
through data to look for patterns and adjusting program actions accordingly.

Machine learning algorithm are often categorised as supervised and unsupervised. Supervised Learning requires requires data
scientists to provide both input and desired output, in addition to furnishing feedback about this accuracy of prediction
during the algorithm training.

Unsupervised algorithm do not nee to be trained with desired outcome data. Instead they use an interactive approach called deep
learning to review data annd arrive at a conclusion. Also called Neural Network. These neural networks work by combining through
millions of examples of training data and automatically identifying often subtle relation between many variables. Once trained
it uses its pool of knowledge to interpret output for new data.
