In procedure oriented programing memory is allocated to all the functions whereas,  in oops the class whose object is created
is executed and is provided with memory

Garbage value increases the time complexity by unnecessarily accompanying the required value hence increase the buffer load time

Souls of memory: The minimum amount of garbage value that can be allowed before releasing all the value.
why we have a a limit before freeing the memory why not remove the garbage value immediately?

Performance based language

Object is a current instance of our class

self are  useful to return  the current instance of the class

Python doesnt support method overloading but operator overloading
Operator Overloading cant be done for string objects

We have a two different class and same method in which child class method will override parent's class method

Python supports multiple inheritance but not interface
